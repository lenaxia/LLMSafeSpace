# Canary Test Plan

**Version:** 3.0  
**Date:** 2026-06-03  
**Scope:** SDK canaries (Go, Python, TypeScript), MCP server canary.  
**Goal:** Structured, scheduled verification that all major SDK and MCP server workflows continue to work against a live deployment, with clear separation between fast/frequent checks and deeper end-to-end flows.

## 1. Design Principles

- **Self-contained.** Every scenario creates its own resources and cleans them up in a `defer`/`finally`, even on failure. No scenario assumes state from a previous run.
- **Two failure modes matter.** A regression shows up either as an error response (wrong status code, missing field) or as a silent degradation (the call succeeds but the observable behavior changed). Both are first-class concerns.
- **Positive and negative.** Every scenario includes at least one happy-path check and at least one failure-path check (wrong credentials, nonexistent resource, malformed input).
- **SDK-faithful.** Canaries call the public SDK surface only. Raw HTTP is used only for MCP (JSON-RPC), health probes, and endpoints the SDKs don't yet expose.
- **Fission-compatible.** Each scenario compiles to a single binary/script that accepts an HTTP `GET` and returns a JSON `Result` object. The same binary runs from the command line with `os.Exit(1)` on failure, so CI uses it directly.
- **Assert, don't just record.** Where a comment in an earlier revision said "record actual behavior," this plan replaces that with a concrete assertion based on the documented API contract.

## 2. Shallow vs. Deep: The Two-Tier Model

The core insight: **not all canaries are equal in cost, risk of flakiness, and what they actually catch**.

### Tier 1 — Shallow (every 1 minute)

**What they test:** API availability, authentication, CRUD plumbing, error shapes, SDK parsing. These can run against any live API server. They create and immediately delete resources. They do **not** wait for Kubernetes to schedule a pod.

**Failure signature:** "The API itself is down or broken" — a 500, a missing field, an auth regression, a serialization bug.

**Target duration:** < 30 seconds. If a shallow canary takes longer, something is already badly wrong (slow DB, overloaded API pod).

**Acceptable flakiness:** Near-zero. These should be essentially deterministic against a healthy server.

**Examples:** `S-AUTH`, `S-APIKEY`, `S-WS-CRUD`, `S-SECRET-CRUD`, `S-ERROR-FORMAT`, `S-HEALTH`.

---

### Tier 2 — Deep (every 5–15 minutes)

**What they test:** Full user workflows that span multiple services: Kubernetes CRD reconciliation, agent startup, credential injection into a running pod, LLM round-trips, session persistence across suspend/resume. These require a workspace to reach `Active` phase.

**Failure signature:** "Something in the controller, agent, or their integration is broken" — a workspace that never becomes Active, a session that fails after resume, a credential that doesn't reach the agent.

**Target duration:** 3–10 minutes depending on workspace startup time.

**Acceptable flakiness:** Low but non-zero. Pod scheduling, image pulls, and LLM provider latency introduce noise. Alert only after 2+ consecutive failures.

**Examples:** `D-SESSION-MSG`, `D-CRED-MODEL-FLOW`, `D-SUSPEND-RESUME-SESSION`.

---

### Why this split matters

Running deep canaries every minute would:
1. Keep the test cluster perpetually littered with provisioning workspaces
2. Cause alert fatigue from legitimate scheduling noise
3. Mask real regressions in the constant churn

Running only shallow canaries would miss the most impactful class of failure: a workspace controller bug that makes every new workspace silently hang at `Pending`.

**The rule:** Shallow canaries tell you if the API is broken. Deep canaries tell you if the product is broken.

### S-HEALTH — API health endpoints

**Schedule:** 1 min | **Max duration:** 10s

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| P1 | `GET /livez` → 200, `{"status":"ok"}` |
| P2 | `GET /health` (alias) → 200, `{"status":"ok"}` |
| P3 | `GET /readyz` → 200, `{"status":"ready"}` |

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| P1 | Valid API key → `GET /auth/me` 200 with `id`, `email`, `role`, `username`, `active` |

| N5 | Login with nonexistent email → same 401 shape as N4 |

---

### S-AUTH-CONFIG — Auth config endpoint

**Schedule:** 1 min | **Max duration:** 10s  
**Note:** This is the first call every frontend client makes. A regression breaks all UIs.

---

### S-LOGOUT — Logout and JWT revocation

**Schedule:** 1 min | **Max duration:** 30s

| P4 | Each setting in schema has `key`, `type`, `default`, `label` fields |
| P5 | `PUT /users/me/settings/theme` with `{"value": "dark"}` → 200 with `key` and `value` |
| P6 | `GET /users/me/settings` after PUT reflects `theme=dark` |
| P7 | Reset: `PUT /users/me/settings/theme` with `{"value": "system"}` → 200 |
| N1 | `GET /users/me/settings` without auth → 401 |
| N2 | `PUT /users/me/settings/theme` with missing `value` body → 400 |
| N3 | `PUT /users/me/settings/nonexistent.key` → 400 (schema validation rejects unknown keys) |

---

### S-WS-CRUD — Workspace CRUD and storage validation

| # | Check |
|---|---|

| P2 | `GET /workspaces/:id` → correct `id` |
| P3 | `GET /workspaces` → `items` array + `pagination` object; created workspace present |
| P4 | `pagination` has `total`, `limit`, `offset` fields |
| P5 | `?limit=1` → at most 1 item; `?limit=1&offset=1` → different item or empty |
| P6 | `PUT /workspaces/:id` (rename) → 204; GET shows new name |

| N2 | DELETE nonexistent ID → error |
| N3 | Create with empty `runtime` → 400 |
| N4 | PUT with missing `name` body → 400 (must run BEFORE delete so workspace still exists) |
| N5 | Create with `storageSize` exceeding `workspace.maxStorageSize` (e.g. `9999Gi`) → 400 |
| N6 | Create with invalid `storageSize` format (e.g. `"invalid"`) → 400 |

| P3 | DELETE → 204; absent from list |
| N1 | DELETE nonexistent → error |
| N2 | Create with malformed provider JSON → 400 |

---

### S-OWNERSHIP — Cross-user isolation

**Schedule:** 5 min | **Max duration:** 60s  
**Requires:** `LLMSAFESPACE_API_KEY_USER2`

**Implementation note (validated against source):** Workspace service routes (`GET`, `DELETE`, status) return **HTTP 403** (ForbiddenError) for cross-user access — not 404. The server intentionally does not hide workspace existence on these routes. The bindings route uses the secrets handler which maps `ErrWorkspaceNotOwned` to **HTTP 404** to prevent cross-user workspace enumeration via the bindings API.

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| P1 | User1 workspace W1: User1 can GET |
| P2 | User2 workspace W2: User2 can GET |
| P3 | User1 list → W1 present, W2 absent |
| P4 | User2 list → W2 present, W1 absent |
| N1 | User2 `GET /workspaces/{W1.id}` → **403 Forbidden** (workspace routes return 403 for ownership violation) |
| N2 | User2 `DELETE /workspaces/{W1.id}` → error (403) |
| N3 | User2 `GET /workspaces/{W1.id}/status` → error (403) |
| N4 | User2 `GET /secrets/{S1.id}` (S1 owned by User1) → error |
| N5 | User2 `POST /workspaces/{W1.id}/sessions/new` → error |

---

### S-ERROR-FORMAT — Error response shape and proxy error shapes

**Schedule:** 1 min | **Max duration:** 20s

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| P1 | 401 `GET /auth/me` without auth → body has `error` string |
| P2 | 404 `GET /workspaces/nonexistent` → body has `error` string |
| P3 | 400 `POST /auth/register` with empty body → body has `error` string |
| P4 | 400 `PUT /workspaces/:id` with missing `name` → body has `error` string |
| P5 | All `error` values are strings (not null, object, or array) |
| P6 | No Go runtime strings (`panic:`, `runtime error:`) in any `error` field |
| P7 | Proxy `workspace not ready` 503: body has `error`, `phase`, and `retryAfter` fields (verified against a workspace in non-Active phase) |
| P8 | Session ID validation: `GET /sessions/../../etc/passwd` → 400 with `error` field (path traversal blocked at API layer) |

| P3 | Status `diskTotalBytes` > 0 (PVC mounted) |
| P4 | Status `agentHealth.status` = `"Healthy"` |
| P5 | `conditions` array contains an entry with `type=CredentialsAvailable` |
| P6 | `POST /suspend` → 202; phase → `Suspended` within 60s |

**Requires:** `LLMSAFESPACE_LLM_API_KEY`

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| P1 | Send `"Reply with exactly: PONG"` → 200 |
| P2 | Response `parts` array present |
| P3 | SDK-extracted `content` non-empty |
| P4 | `GET /workspaces/:id/status` after message: `lastActivityAt` is non-null and recent (within last 60s) |
| P5 | `GET /sessions/:id/message` (default, no verbose) → `patch` type parts absent |
| P6 | `GET /sessions/:id/message?verbose=true` → `patch` type parts present (if the model produced any) |
| N1 | Send to nonexistent session → error |
| N2 | Send to session of workspace owned by different user → 404 or 403 |

---

### D-SESSION-HISTORY — Session history

**Schedule:** 5 min | **Max duration:** 300s  
**Requires:** `LLMSAFESPACE_LLM_API_KEY`

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| P1 | History before any messages → 200, empty array |
| P2 | After 2 messages → history has ≥ 2 entries |
| P3 | Entries have parseable `parts` structure |
| N1 | History for nonexistent session → error |

---

### D-SESSION-TITLE — Auto-generated session title backfill

**Schedule:** 10 min | **Max duration:** 300s  
**Requires:** `LLMSAFESPACE_LLM_API_KEY`

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| P1 | Send a substantive message (not just "PONG") |
| P2 | Wait up to 20s; `GET /sessions` shows non-empty `title` for the session |
| P3 | `GET /workspaces/:id/sessions/:sessionId` shows non-empty `title` |

---

### D-SESSION-LIMIT — Active session limit (429) and connection limit (429)

**Schedule:** 10 min | **Max duration:** 480s

Two distinct 429 paths:

**A) Active session limit** (per-workspace concurrent LLM calls):
| # | Check |
|---|---|
| P1 | Fill active session slots by sending concurrent messages |
| P2 | Next concurrent message → 429 with `maxActiveSessions` and `retryAfter` fields |
| P3 | After abort, new message succeeds |

**B) Connection limit** (per-workspace concurrent proxy connections, limit = 10):
| # | Check |
|---|---|
| P4 | Open 11 concurrent `GET /events` SSE streams on same workspace |
| P5 | 11th connection → 429 with `retryAfter` field |

---

### D-SESSION-GET — Individual session GET endpoint

**Schedule:** 5 min | **Max duration:** 180s

Tests `GET /workspaces/:id/sessions/:sessionId` which proxies to opencode's `GET /session/:id`.

|---|---|
| P1 | After ensure session → `GET /sessions/:sessionId` → 200 |
| P2 | Response has `id` matching the session |
| P3 | Response has `title` field (may be empty string pre-message) |

**Schedule:** 5 min | **Max duration:** 300s  
**Requires:** `LLMSAFESPACE_LLM_API_KEY`  
**Critical:** This is the code path the MCP server uses internally. If it breaks, the MCP `session_message` tool breaks while all SDK tests pass.

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| P1 | `POST /sessions/:id/prompt_async` with `{"message": "Reply: ASYNC-OK"}` → 202 (immediate response) |
| P2 | Connect to `GET /events` (SSE stream) |
| P3 | Receive `session.status` event with `status=idle` and matching `session_id` within 60s |
| P4 | `GET /sessions/:id/message` → history contains the agent's response |
| P5 | Abort: `POST /sessions/:id/prompt_async` again, immediately `POST /sessions/:id/abort` → no hang |
| N1 | `POST /prompt_async` with malformed session ID → 400 |
| N2 | `POST /prompt_async` on workspace in non-Active phase → 503 with `phase` and `retryAfter` |

---

**Schedule:** 10 min | **Max duration:** 480s  
**Requires:** `LLMSAFESPACE_LLM_API_KEY`  
**Note:** Requires a prompt that triggers a tool-use permission. Skip gracefully if model doesn't trigger permissions for test prompt.

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| P1 | `GET /question` → 200, array (may be empty) |
| P2 | `GET /permission` → 200, array |
| P3 | Send message that triggers tool-use permission |
| P4 | `GET /permission` returns ≥ 1 pending permission with `id` |
| P5 | `POST /permission/:id/reply` with `{"reply": "once"}` → no error |
| P6 | After approval, session returns to idle (confirm via SSE or status) |
| N1 | `POST /question/:id/reply` with invalid ID format (not `que_...`) → 400 |
| N2 | `POST /permission/:id/reply` with invalid reply value (`"maybe"`) → 400 |
| N3 | `POST /permission/:id/reply` with invalid ID format (not `per_...`) → 400 |

---

### D-SESSION-SUBTASK — Subagent `parentId` backfill

**Schedule:** 15 min | **Max duration:** 600s  
**Requires:** `LLMSAFESPACE_LLM_API_KEY`  
**Note:** Requires a prompt that causes opencode to spawn a subtask agent (e.g. complex coding task with `task` tool). Skip gracefully if model doesn't use the task tool.

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| P1 | Send a message that triggers a subagent session |
| P2 | Wait up to 30s; `GET /sessions` contains a session with non-empty `parentId` |
| P3 | `parentId` references the top-level session's ID |
| N1 | A session with no parent has `parentId` absent or null (not an empty string) |

---

### D-TERMINAL — Terminal ticket generation

**Schedule:** 5 min | **Max duration:** 300s

| P2 | `ticket` length > 10 |
| P3 | `expiresAt` non-empty string |
| P4 | Two consecutive tickets are different (uniqueness) |
| N1 | Ticket for nonexistent workspace → error |
| N2 | Ticket for workspace owned by another user → error |

---

### D-CRED-BIND — Credential bind + reload + unbind + reload-empty

**Schedule:** 5 min | **Max duration:** 300s

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| P1 | Create workspace, wait `Active` |
| P2 | Create credential, bind → 204 |
| P3 | `GET /bindings` → credential ID present |
| P4 | `POST /reload-secrets` → 200 with `reloaded` integer ≥ 1 |
| P5 | Status `credentialState.available` = `true` after reload |
| P6 | Unbind (empty list) → 204; `GET /bindings` → empty |
| P7 | `POST /reload-secrets` after unbind → 200 with `reloaded: 0` (not an error) |
| P8 | Status `credentialState.available` after clearing → false or not-set |
| N1 | `POST /reload-secrets` on suspended workspace → 409 (`errNoRunningPod`) |

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| P1 | `GET /models` → 200 with `models` array and `currentModel` string |
| P2 | Each model has `id`, `name`, `enabled`, `tier` (`"free"` or `"paid"`), `freeTier` (bool), `selected` (bool) |
| P3 | Exactly one model has `selected=true` and its `id` equals `currentModel` |
| P4 | After `PUT /model` changes model, `GET /models` shows new `currentModel` and updated `selected` |
| N1 | `GET /models` on nonexistent workspace → error |

---

### D-MODEL-SET — Set model and verify agent uses it

**Schedule:** 5 min | **Max duration:** 300s

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| P1 | `PUT /model` with valid model → 204 |
| P2 | `GET /models` shows new model selected |
| P3 | Send message → agent responds (non-empty, no auth error) |
| N1 | `PUT /model` with empty `model` → 400 |
| N2 | `PUT /model` on nonexistent workspace → error |
| N3 | `PUT /model` with `LLMSAFESPACE_BAD_MODEL` → API accepts (validation deferred to agent) OR returns 400; either way, agent must not crash the workspace (verify phase still `Active` after) |

---

- D-KEY-ROTATE / D-CHANGE-PASSWORD / D-ACCOUNT-RECOVER: alert on 2nd failure (these mutate credentials).

---

## 9. CI Integration

**Job name:** `sdk-canary` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

All `ci:fast` (Tier 1 shallow) scenarios run in CI. They do not wait for pod scheduling and do not require `LLMSAFESPACE_LLM_API_KEY`. They run against the kind cluster or a local mock server.

**ci:fast scenario list:** S-HEALTH, S-AUTH, S-AUTH-CONFIG, S-LOGOUT, S-APIKEY, S-USER-SETTINGS, S-WS-CRUD, S-WS-STATUS, S-WS-QUOTA, S-SECRET-CRUD, S-SECRET-REVEAL, S-SECRET-AUDIT, S-CRED-CRUD, S-OWNERSHIP, S-ERROR-FORMAT, S-MCP-TOOLS, S-MCP-AUTH-NEG, S-MCP-CRED, S-MCP-INPUT-NEG

**Running locally:**
```bash
# All ci:fast scenarios, all SDKs
make canary-ci

# Single scenario, Go SDK
LLMSAFESPACE_URL=http://localhost:8080 LLMSAFESPACE_API_KEY=lsp_... \
  go run ./sdks/canary/go/auth/

# Full canary suite (requires live cluster with LLM credentials)
make canary-all
```

---

## 10. Test Accounts

Three pre-provisioned accounts required in every deployment:

| Account | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `canary1@llmsafespace.test` | Primary account for all single-user scenarios |
| `canary2@llmsafespace.test` | Secondary account for S-OWNERSHIP |
| `canary-rotate@llmsafespace.test` | Dedicated account for D-KEY-ROTATE, D-CHANGE-PASSWORD, D-ACCOUNT-RECOVER (these mutate credentials; isolated to prevent interference with canary1) |

All accounts are non-admin. The rotate account has a known fixed password stored in a Kubernetes Secret and is reset to the original value at the end of each mutation scenario.

---

## 11. What Is Explicitly Out of Scope

| Excluded | Reason |
|---|---|
| User registration | Explicitly requested out of scope |
| Admin credential set management (`/admin/credentials`) | Requires admin account |
| Admin settings (`/admin/settings`) | Requires admin account |
| WebSocket terminal session (`ws://`) | Fission functions cannot hold long-lived WebSocket connections; covered by e2e nightly |
| Load / throughput / performance testing | Separate benchmark suite (`hack/benchmark-*.sh`) |
| Database migration correctness | Covered by `migration-safety` CI workflow |
| Kubernetes CRD schema validation | Covered by `helm-render` CI step |
| Security / penetration testing | Handled by dedicated security tooling |

---

## 12. Changelog

|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | 2026-06-03 | Initial plan — 33 scenarios |
| 2.0 | 2026-06-03 | Added two-tier model; added 18 missing workflows (logout/revocation, auth/config, secrets audit, key rotation, account recovery, question/permission flow, verbose flag, SSE events, user settings, rate limiting, session limit, env injection) |
| 3.0 | 2026-06-03 | Added 20 additional gaps: proxy error shapes (`workspace not ready` 503, path traversal 400), storage validation (size too large, invalid format), `imageTag`/`agentVersion` in list, `activate` auto-eviction flow, `ensure-session` auto-resume assertion, status fields (`imageTag`, disk/memory/context, `conditions`, `lastActivityAt`), session `parentId` backfill, schema version drift detection, idempotency cases (re-create after delete, double bind, reload-empty), suspend-already-suspended as 409 assertion, resume-already-active idempotency, `GET /sessions/:sessionId` individual endpoint, `prompt_async`+SSE as first-class scenario, connection limit 429, `D-MCP-PROMPT-ASYNC` to catch MCP-specific path breakage |
