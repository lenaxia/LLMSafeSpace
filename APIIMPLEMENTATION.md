# Implementation Order for API Package

Based on the files you've shared, here's a recommended implementation order that respects dependencies and allows for incremental testing:

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. **Logger (`logger.go`)**
   - Implement first as it has no dependencies
   - Other components depend on logging functionality

2. **Config (`config.go`)**
   - Implement early as many components need configuration
   - Only depends on standard libraries

3. **Errors (`errors.go`)**
   - Define error types and handling
   - No significant dependencies

4. **Interfaces (`interfaces.go`)**
   - Define service interfaces
   - This is a contract definition, not an implementation

## Phase 2: Middleware Components

5. **Request ID Middleware (`request_id.go`)**
   - Simple middleware with minimal dependencies
   - Needed by other middleware components

6. **Tracing Middleware (`tracing.go`)**
   - Depends on logger
   - Enhances request context

7. **Recovery Middleware (`recovery.go`)**
   - Depends on logger and errors
   - Critical for application stability

8. **Logging Middleware (`logging.go`)**
   - Depends on logger and request ID middleware

9. **Security Middleware (`security.go`)**
   - Implements CORS and security headers
   - Relatively independent

10. **Error Handler Middleware (`error_handler.go`)**
    - Depends on errors package and logger

## Phase 3: Core Services

11. **Database Service (`database.go`)**
    - Fundamental service many others depend on
    - Implement migrations (`migration.go`) alongside this

12. **Cache Service (`cache.go`)**
    - Depends on config and logger
    - Used by many other services

13. **Metrics Service (`metrics.go`)**
    - Depends on logger
    - Used for instrumentation

14. **Auth Service (`auth.go`)**
    - Depends on database, cache, config, and logger
    - Required for protected endpoints

## Phase 4: Domain Services

15. **File Service (`file.go`)**
    - Depends on logger and Kubernetes client
    - Relatively independent from other domain services

16. **Execution Service (`execution.go`)**
    - Depends on logger and Kubernetes client
    - Core functionality for code execution

17. **Warm Pool Service (`warmpool_service.go`)**
    - Depends on logger, Kubernetes client, database, and cache
    - Optimizes sandbox creation

18. **Sandbox Service**
    - Most complex service with many dependencies
    - Depends on all previous services
    - Implement in sub-components:
      - Session management
      - File operations
      - Execution integration
      - Warm pool integration

## Phase 5: API Layer

19. **Validation (`validation.go`, `sandbox.go`, `warmpool.go`)**
    - Implement request validation
    - Depends on errors package

20. **Middleware Integration (`metrics.go`, `auth.go`, `rate_limit.go`, `validation.go`)**
    - Connect middleware to services

21. **Router (`router.go`)**
    - Set up routes and middleware chain
    - Depends on all middleware components

22. **Handlers**
    - Implement API endpoints
    - Depends on services and validation

## Phase 6: Application Bootstrap

23. **Services Manager (`services.go`)**
    - Orchestrates service initialization and lifecycle
    - Depends on all services

24. **Application (`app.go`)**
    - Main application entry point
    - Depends on services manager, router, and config

25. **Main (`main.go`)**
    - Application bootstrap
    - Minimal code, mostly delegating to app package

## Implementation Tips

1. **Test as you go**: Implement unit tests alongside each component
2. **Mock dependencies**: Use the mock implementations in the `mocks` directory
3. **Incremental integration**: After implementing each phase, perform integration tests
4. **Database migrations**: Implement and test migrations early
5. **Documentation**: Update API documentation as you implement endpoints

This order minimizes dependency issues and allows you to build and test incrementally. The most complex components (sandbox service, handlers) come later when their dependencies are already in place and tested.
