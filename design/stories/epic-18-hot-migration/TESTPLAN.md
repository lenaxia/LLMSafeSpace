| U2.7 | Concurrent Migration for same workspace → second rejected (Failed) | Unhappy | Single-migration-per-workspace invariant |

## E2E Tests (Cross-Story)

| ID | Test | Type | What It Validates |
|----|------|------|-------------------|
| E2E.1 | **Full migration lifecycle:** Create workspace → user sends prompt → response streaming → trigger migration → handoff gap (503 retries) → stream resumes on target → conversation intact | Happy | Complete user journey |
| E2E.2 | **Spot reclamation under load:** 5 workspaces on Spot node, 3 with active sessions → Spot interrupt → all migrate within 75s or suspend gracefully | Robustness | Spot at scale |
| E2E.3 | **Migration + suspend + resume:** Migrate workspace → suspend → resume → verify pod name reverts to deterministic, conversation history intact | Edge | Lifecycle interaction |
| E2E.4 | **Migration rollback:** Trigger migration → inject failure at StartingTarget (target opencode crashes) → verify source pod resumes serving within 30s | Unhappy | Rollback UX |
| E2E.5 | **Concurrent migrations on same node:** 5 workspaces migrate simultaneously from hot node → all complete, no interference | Robustness | Parallel migration |
| E2E.6 | **Migration during active tool use:** Agent is executing a file write tool → migration triggers → tool completes on source → next request served by target | Edge | Mid-operation migration |
| E2E.7 | **Multi-tenant isolation during migration:** Tenant A migrates → Tenant B's workspace unaffected, cannot observe migration | Security | Tenant boundary |
| E2E.8 | **SQLite integrity after migration:** Migrate workspace → verify `PRAGMA integrity_check` passes on target → all sessions/messages present | Robustness | No data corruption |
| E2E.9 | **Repeated migrations:** Migrate workspace 5 times in sequence (A→B→A→B→A) → workspace functional after each, no state accumulation or leak | Robustness | Repeated migration stability |
| E2E.10 | **Migration under memory pressure:** Node at 85% memory → load balancer triggers migration → workspace moves to healthy node → node pressure drops below 65% | Happy | Load balancing effectiveness |
| E2E.11 | **Provider reconnection timing:** Migrate workspace → measure time from stop-opencode to target readyz → assert < 15s p99 | Performance | Handoff SLO |
| E2E.12 | **Zero dropped requests:** Send 100 requests/s during migration → verify all get 200 or retryable 503 → none get 500 or timeout | Performance | Request safety |
| E2E.13 | **Dirty WAL recovery:** SIGKILL source opencode (simulating drain timeout) → start target opencode on same PVC → `PRAGMA integrity_check` passes → sessions readable | Robustness | WAL recovery on NFS after unclean shutdown |
| E2E.14 | **Migration during opencode crash-loop:** Source opencode in CrashLoopBackOff → trigger migration → migration completes (stop-opencode is no-op since already dead) → target opencode starts fresh → DB intact | Edge | Degraded source state |
| E2E.15 | **Network partition during rollback:** Migration at StartingTarget → kill network to target pod → controller times out → rollback deletes target pod → source opencode restarted → verify only ONE opencode running at end | Robustness | Partition safety (invariant: never two opencode on same DB) |
| E2E.16 | **Migration CR deleted mid-flight:** Migration at StartingTarget → delete Migration CR → finalizer triggers cleanup → target pod deleted → source opencode restarted → workspace serving | Edge | Admin intervention safety |
| E2E.17 | **Status update race:** Force workspace reconciler to reconcile during CuttingOver → verify migration controller's podIP/podName update wins (optimistic concurrency retry) | Robustness | Controller coexistence |
| E2E.18 | **Migration during init script:** Workspace with slow init script (writing files to /workspace) → trigger migration → init killed with source pod → target pod re-runs init → workspace functional | Edge | Init interaction |
| E2E.19 | **Close-to-open consistency baseline:** Process A on node-1 writes 1MB file → closes → process B on node-2 opens → reads → content matches byte-for-byte. Run on actual RWX backend (EFS or Longhorn). | Robustness | Storage prerequisite validation |
| E2E.20 | **Migration on just-resumed workspace:** Resume workspace → immediately trigger migration (pod still in init containers) → migration waits or fails gracefully (doesn't snapshot non-ready agentd) | Edge | Race with resume |
| E2E.21 | **Finalizer stuck:** Migration at StoppingSource → source pod already deleted (node died) → finalizer can't reach source → finalizer times out → CR deleted after 60s | Edge | Finalizer doesn't block forever |
| E2E.22 | **Migration CR for Failed workspace:** Workspace in Failed phase → create Migration CR → immediately rejected (Failed) | Edge | Invalid trigger prevention |
| E2E.23 | **Idempotent CreatingTarget:** Controller crashes after creating target pod but before status update → restarts → finds existing target pod (AlreadyExists) → proceeds to WaitingAgentd | Robustness | Phase idempotency |
