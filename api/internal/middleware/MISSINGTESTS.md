## Missing Core Unit Tests

1. **Middleware Chaining Tests**
   - Test how multiple middleware components work together in a chain
   - Verify correct order of execution and context propagation between middleware

2. **Context Value Propagation Tests**
   - More thorough tests for how values are set and retrieved from the Gin context across middleware
   - Test edge cases where context values might be overwritten

3. **Error Handling Edge Cases**
   - Tests for concurrent error handling
   - Tests for nested errors (errors within errors)
   - Tests for error handling with large payloads

4. **Validation Middleware Additional Tests**
   - Tests for nested object validation
   - Tests for array validation
   - Tests for custom validation rules with complex logic

5. **Auth Middleware Additional Tests**
   - Tests for token expiration
   - Tests for different authentication methods (API key, JWT, OAuth)
   - Tests for role-based access control with complex permission hierarchies

6. **Rate Limiting Additional Tests**
   - Tests for distributed rate limiting
   - Tests for rate limit bursting behavior
   - Tests for rate limit reset behavior

## Integration Tests to Consider

1. **API Flow Tests**
   - End-to-end tests that simulate complete API flows
   - Test authentication → validation → business logic → response

2. **Middleware Stack Integration**
   - Test the complete middleware stack as configured in your production application
   - Verify that middleware components interact correctly when all are active

3. **Database Integration Tests**
   - Test how middleware interacts with database operations
   - Test transaction handling and rollbacks

4. **Cache Integration Tests**
   - Test how middleware interacts with cache services
   - Test cache hit/miss scenarios and their impact on middleware behavior

5. **Kubernetes Client Integration Tests**
   - Test how middleware interacts with Kubernetes client operations
   - Test error handling for Kubernetes API failures

6. **Load and Performance Tests**
   - Test middleware performance under load
   - Identify bottlenecks in the middleware chain

7. **Security Integration Tests**
   - Test CSRF protection across different request types
   - Test XSS protection with various payloads
   - Test SQL injection protection

8. **Logging and Monitoring Integration**
   - Test that logs are properly generated and formatted
   - Test that metrics are properly collected and reported
